# EZ Tabletop Library
## FAQ
### What is LIBEZTP?
LIBEZTP is a C++ library aimed at create an easy to use library for tabletop game adaptations made in C++.
It has the necessary features to make and manage characters, items, and races in an easy format.
This is mostly because I plan on making some DM tools and one universal library would be pretty slick.

### How do you use LIBEZTP 
You just need to download the source files from GitHub and throw them in like any other source library.
Binary library may come soon (maybe).

### Where did the code for LIBEZTP come from?
I tried to make a Server-Client D&D application in mostly headers.
I failed miserably and rebranded it as a D&D framework, but a lot of the code was actually decent.
I'm using this to fix the mistakes I made and make it an actual usable library.

## Requirements
 * C++17 or above
